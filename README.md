Alpha Prototype: Find Yourself 

Team Members: Bingkun Han, Ian Weller, and Jake Ramussen

. Game Engine: The game engine we will be using for our alternative game will be the Unreal engine. 

. Game Play: The primary system in our game is going to be called the mind meter, and it’s going to be a UI element. 
  If the meter reaches zero before the player finds a way of escaping, they lose. The meter will gradually deplete 
  over time and depending on what the player does the meter can be refill partially or drained partially.
  
Examples of things that will refill the meter or slow the rate at which it decreases temporarily are, finding pictures of 
people, finding a phone to call or text someone on the outside world (the game will then prompt the player to call a loved
one or friend), a breathing exercise the player will be guided through, repeating a mantra that will motivate the player, 
reading motivational short stories, reading jokes, and telling the player to get up and stretch or even go for a short five
minute walk. All these features are subject to change. 

Examples of things that will drain the meter or increase the rate at which it decreases are, finding skeletons or other
things that remind the player they are alone, during the night the meter will decrease a little faster than during the day,
when the meter is low enough the player will begin to hallucinate which will further decrease the rate at which the meter 
drains, if the player has not done any breathing, phone call, or stretching exercises in a while the meter will increase 
the rate at which mind drains. Again, we can adjust and change this later in development if needed.

. OGrES: This game is aimed as a form of exposure therapy for those suffering from Monophobia, which causes those afflicted
  to feel immense anxiety and dread when they are alone. This game aims to educate what Monophobia might feel like for those
  who don’t suffer from it and to act as a form of interactive controlled exposure therapy for those with Monophobia. Find Yourself
  not only seeks to educate what Monophobia is like, but also as exposure therapy for those with Monophobia to better understand
  and control their fear of being alone. 

Build: Find Yourself  was built to run on Windows for the PC, https://github.com/kogasaa/FindYourself/blob/master/FindYourself.uproject
. Controls: The controls are WASD to move around, and space is used to jump, we are implementing more features and movements 
  as we progress but for the time being we only have these controls.
